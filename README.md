I thought I'd use Bun this time instead of NodeJS to try something new
I must say- `bun install` is faster than `pnpm` and `npm` hehe; I love `bun install`

# Hosting instructions

1. Install Bun :D
2. Clone the repo
3. `cd` into the frontend and backend directories and run `bun install` in each
4. Run `bun run dev` in both folders too
5. Visit `localhost:3000` in your browser
6. Use it to organize your messy student life :p
